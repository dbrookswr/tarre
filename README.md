R function and examples for Treating All Rapid Responses as Errors (Incorrect)

This is the folder for:
"Treating Rapid Responses as Incorrect for Non-Timed Formative Tests." 
The paper has recently been accepted and will be in Open Education Studies 
(https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/edu).
This is part of DeGruyter's Open access set of journals and as such they'd
like you to go there to get it (I'll put the url here when available). I 
have put the R code here both to make it easier to use and to encourage 
people to add examples. I have put the LaTeX file here also for replicability 
purposes. It uses knitr and has all the R code included. To compile this you
will need several LaTeX and R packages.

Note also that this is a follow-up to Wright, D. B. (2016). Treating All 
Rapid Responses as Errors (TARRE) improves estimates of ability (slightly). 
Psychological Test and Assessment Modeling, 58, 15â€“31.

That paper used ACT data and found, well, the title says what was found.

The same data reported here was used for: Wright, D. B. (in press). Speed gaps: 
Exploring differences in response latencies among groups. Educational 
Measurement: Issues and Practice.

Thanks to Summit Learning for providing access to the data and thanks to the 
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative for funding.
